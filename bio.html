			<h> My name is Jarod Glover, a junior majoring in Computer Science at Tufts University and a member of the Men's Soccer Team. During my time at Tufts University, I have completed Introduction to Computer Science, Data Structures, and Machine Structure and Programming. My passion has always been deep analysis and problem-solving. I have an extensive background with data entry and Microsoft, with in-depth knowledge of programming languages including C++, and some knowledge of Python, HTML, and Java.  Along with taking classes in Machine Structure and Programming, I have also taken two marketing classes whilst at Tufts.
