				<h> This is a short bio about myself. 
					I have 17,000 brothers and sisters and every day is a 
					battle for survival. From an early age I made my alliances 
					so as not to fall to low on the pecking order. During the 
					day we rested and during the night we hunted in order to 
					feed ourselves. My upbringing has prepared me for the harsh 
					wilderness that is modern day society.
